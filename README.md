A generic Node.js Application plugin for the [asdf version manager](https://asdf-vm.com).

**What is a "Node.js Application"?**

For purposes of this plugin, a Node.js Application is a program that _happens_ to be written in Node.js, but otherwise behaves like a regular command-line tool.

Examples of Node.js Applications are [bash-language-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bash-language-server) and [@angular/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/cli). See below for more compatible applications.

# Dependencies

- `node` and `npm` >= 16
- OR [asdf-nodejs](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs) installed

# Install

Plugin:

```shell
asdf plugin add <node app> https://github.com/mattysweeps/asdf-nodeapp.git
# for example
asdf plugin add bash-language-server https://github.com/mattysweeps/asdf-nodeapp.git
```

Example using `bash-language-server`:

```shell
# Show all installable versions
asdf list-all bash-language-server

# Install specific version
asdf install bash-language-server latest

# Set a version globally (on your ~/.tool-versions file)
asdf global bash-language-server latest

# Now bash-language-server commands are available
bash-language-server --help
```

# How it Works

asdf-nodeapp is a lot more complex than most asdf plugins since it's designed to work with generic Node.js Applications, and challenges that come with Node.js package management.

asdf-nodeapp uses the same technique as [asdf-hashicorp](https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-hashicorp) to use a single plugin for multiple tools.

When installing a tool, asdf-nodeapp creates a fresh directory with its own `node_modules` and npm-installs the package matching the plugin name. Then it symlinks the binaries provided by the package to make them available to asdf.

## Node.js Resolution

To run Node.js Applications, you need Node.js. The Node.js runtime is chosen
in the following order:

1. Use `ASDF_NODEAPP_DEFAULT_NODE_PATH` if it is set
2. Use the global node `/usr/local/bin/node` if it exists
3. Use the `node` in our path
4. Use the `node` set by the asdf-nodejs plugin

## asdf-nodejs Integration (Experimental)

Here we color outside the lines a bit :)

asdf-nodejs supports installing a Node.js App with a _specific_ Node.js version using a special syntax. This feature requires the [asdf-nodejs](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs) plugin to be installed.

The general form is:

```shell
asdf <app> install <app-version>@<node-version>
```

For example, to install `bash-language-server` 3.1.0 with Node.js 18.17.0:

```shell
asdf bash-language-server install 3.1.0@18.17.0
```

Node.js Apps with different Node.js versions and Node.js itself can all happily co-exist in the same project. For example, take this `.tool-versions`:

```shell
nodejs 18.17.0
bash-language-server 3.1.0
eslint 8.45.0@16.20.0
prettier 3.0.0@18.17.0
```

- `bash-language-server` will be installed with the global Node.js (see Node.js Resolution), in an isolated directory
- Node.js 16.20.0 will be used for `eslint` installation
- `prettier` will be installed with Node.js 18.17.0, but isolated from the project's Node.js, which is also 18.17.0.

# Configuration

## Environment Variables

- `ASDF_NODEAPP_INCLUDE_DEPS` - when set to `1`, this plugin will consider the executables of the dependencies of the installed package as well. For example, when installing `@angular/cli`, additional commands from its dependencies might also be made available.
- `ASDF_NODEAPP_DEFAULT_NODE_PATH` - Path to a `node` binary this plugin should use. Default is unset. See Node.js Resolution section for more details.
- `ASDF_NODEAPP_DEBUG` - Set to `1` for additional logging

# Background and Inspiration

asdf-nodeapp was inspired by [asdf-hashicorp](https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-hashicorp) and [asdf-pyapp](https://github.com/amrox/asdf-pyapp). Big thanks to the creators, contributors, and maintainers of both these projects.
